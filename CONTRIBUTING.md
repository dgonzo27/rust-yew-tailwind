# Contributing to rust-yew-tailwind

If you would like to become an active contributor to this project, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/dgonzo27/rust-yew-tailwind/issues) with the _contributor_ template.

## Branching Strategy

In this strategy, there is only a single branch or _"source of truth"_ - the `master` branch. The idea behind this strategy is to minimize the amount of human interaction required to maintain branches and to minimize the overrall number of maintained branches in general.

- When developing a new feature or resolving a bug, checkout to a `features/*` or `bugs/*` branch using your approved GitHub issue number. For example, `features/git-issue-6`.

- When you are finished developing, you'll push your code and create a pull request to the `master` branch.

- Once the branch is approved and merged the branch will be deleted.
